Traffic Collision Analysis â€“ Uncovering Road Safety Patterns in Los Angeles

Urban mobility comes with its share of challenges â€” and road safety is one of the biggest. I recently worked on an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project to study traffic collision data in Los Angeles, aiming to uncover trends, identify hotspots, and extract insights from real-world data.

Key Highlights:

ðŸ”¹ Identify High-Risk Areas â€“ Locate collision hotspots in Los Angeles using geospatial analysis.
 ðŸ”¹ Assess Trends and Patterns â€“ Analyze how traffic accidents vary year-over-year and seasonally.
 ðŸ”¹ Enhance Road Safety Measures â€“ Derive data-driven suggestions for better infrastructure and safety.
 ðŸ”¹ Evaluate Policy Impact â€“ Examine the effectiveness of previous traffic regulations and planning.
 ðŸ”¹ Support Predictive Analytics â€“ Build models to predict accident-prone zones and times.

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
